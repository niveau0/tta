   Type:        command
   Usage:       eat &lt;item&gt;

   Description: Depending on your constitution your body will show you more
                or less often, that you are hungry. 
                'You get an inconsiderable feeling of hunger.'
                How thirsty or hungry you are, can be also seen in your 
                personal informations (stats).
                Bread or other food is mostly sold in pubs, but it is also
                possible to get meat from some dead animals.
		If you don't eat when you body shows hunger, you will die 
                soon by starvation.
