<pre>
   There are quite a few different classes of weapons, each one marked by
   a skill  of it's own.  You will need  to learn  that specific skill to
   handle a weapon of that kind, and you will need  a trainer to help you
   understanding the ways of handling it.

   Weapons of poor quality  tend to fare not  so well in a  combat, while
   superiour weapons  might give you  that urgently needed edge. But they
   are rare and quite expensive most of the time.

   Most melee weapons emphasize your strength, but quite a bit of agility
   is needed   as well, bows favour  a  dexterous person,  while throwing
   something (including  your foe with sweeps  and throws)  asks for both
   abilities.

   To get more information, check out the following topics:

   Melee Weapons       Various equipment to defend yourself

   Missile Weapons     Items to use from afar

   Throwing/Throw      How to throw something at your foe

   Unarmed Combat      Martial arts and brawling

   Specials            Unusual skills related to combat

   Natural Combat      Unlikely you'll ever use those
