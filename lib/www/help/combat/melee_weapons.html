<pre>
   Melee weapons are those which can be  wielded and are used to strike,
   bash or slash at a foe. All of them got a unique handling and usually
   vary greatly in size, weight and usefulness.

   Different kinds of weapons achieve  different results when confronted
   with armor, a short  sword might be  a good weapon,  but it lacks the
   power to penetrate  a platemail most  of the time,  while a warhammer
   might be a  lot better suited  to dent that  piece of armor  and hurt
   the wearer.  You will have to  apply common  sense when judging those
   effects, additionally you can experiment with them a bit.

   Knowing  the  skill to handle  the weapon  is  essential, it includes
   attacking as well as parrying, and your  knowledge will be influenced
   by the quality  of  the weapon you use   as well of  the trainer  who
   helped you with his knowledge.
