   DGD-Editor command reference.
   
   'ed' is a lineoriented editor. It has like the unix 'vi' a command and
   an insert modus. 
 
   : is the prompt in command modus.
   * is the prompt in insert/edit modus.

   There are 26 buffers available.
   Instead of a &lt;count&gt; it is possible to specify the range of lines _before_
   the command. E.g. for the delete command:
      &lt;firstline&gt;,&lt;lastline&gt; delete

   Command flags
   -------------
   p	print the current line after the command. This is default.
   l	print the current line after the command in 'list' format.
   #	print the current line after the command in 'number' format.
   +	increase the current line number by 1 before printing it.
   -	decrease the current line number by 1 before printing it.

   append								a
   Enter Insert Mode and append lines after the specified line.

   Enter Insert Mode and replace the specified lines.
   
   copy &lt;line&gt; [count] [flags]						co

   The line might be 0, in which case the copied lines are
   inserted before the first line in the main buffer.
   
   delete [buffer] [count] [flags]					d
   Delete the specified lines.  The deleted lines are saved in the
   default buffer, and in the secondary buffer if one is specified.
   
   edit [file]								e

   secondary buffers will be discarded.  The current line will be
   placed at the last line of the main buffer.
   
   edit! [file]								e!
   Start editing a new file, even if the current main buffer was
   modified.

   By default, the matching lines are just printed.
   
   global! /pattern/ [command]						g!
   Execute the command on all lines not matching the given pattern.
   By default, the lines that don't match are just printed.
   
   insert								i
   Enter Insert Mode and insert lines before the specified one.

   join [count] [flags]							j

   space at the beginning of a next line will be discarded.
   Unless the next line starts with ')', a space is inserted
   between two joined lines, or two spaces if the first line ends
   in '.'.

   join! [count] [flags]						j!
   Join the specified lined together in a single line without
   white space processing.
   
   list [count] [flags]							l
   Show the specified lines, displaying tabs as '^I' and marking
   the end of the line with '$'.
   
   mark x								k
   Mark the specified line with x, a single lowercase letter.  If
   the abbreviation 'k' is used, there need not be any spaces

   read [file]								r

   set [parameter]							se
   Set without argument shows the current values of the editor
   variables.  Variables are numeric or toggles.  Toggles can be
   turned on with 'set option' and turned off with 'set nooption'.
   Numeric variables can be given a value with 'set numeric=value'.
   The following variables exist:
   
       NAME	ABBREV	DEFAULT	MEANING
   
       ignorecase	ic	noic	ignore case in searches.
       shiftwidth	sw	4	affects the '&lt;', '&gt;' and 'I'
   					commands.
       window	wi	20		specifies the number of lines
   					displayed with the z command.
   
   
   substitute /pattern/replacement/ [g] [count] [flags]			s
   Replace &lt;pattern&gt; by &lt;replacement&gt; in the specified lines.  If
   the 'g' option is specified, repeat the substitution in each
   line until all occurrances of &lt;pattern&gt; have been replaced.
   In &lt;replacement&gt;, \x, where x is a digit in range 1-9, specifies
   the xth subexpression in &lt;pattern&gt;, which is enclosed by \( \)
   pairs in &lt;pattern&gt;.  Furthermore, '&' in &lt;replacement&gt; specifies
   the text that matched &lt;pattern&gt;, and '\n' in &lt;replacement&gt;
   specifies a newline, splitting the line in two.  If the symbols
   '&' and '\' themselves are desired in &lt;replacement&gt;, they should
   be prefixed by '\'.  All parameters are optional. 'substitute'
   by itself will repeat the previous substitution.
   
   t &lt;line&gt; [flags]
   An alias for the 'copy' command.
   
   undo									u
   Undo the effects of the previous command on the main buffer.
   'edit' and 'yank' commands can not be undone, and 'global'

   v /pattern/ [command]
   An alias for the 'global!' command.

   Write the specified lines to [file], or to the current file if
   no argument is specified.
   
   write! [file]							w!
   Write the specified lines to [file], even if some error
   occurred that prevented the main buffer from containing an exact
   image of the file that is being edited.
   
   write &gt;&gt; [file]							w&gt;&gt;
   This variant of write appends to a file, instead of overwriting
   it.

   editing session.
   
   wq! [file]

   buffer from containing an exact image of the file that is being

   Write the main buffer to the current file if it was modified,
   and quit this editing session.
   
   yank [buffer] [count] [flags]					y
   Copy the specified lines to the secondary buffer given in the
   argument, or just to the default buffer if no argument is given.
   
   z [mode] [flags]
   Show a page of lines, starting with the specified line.  The
   number of lines displayed is determined by the value of the
   'window' variable, which can be changed by the 'set' command.
   [mode] can be one of the following:
   
       +	show specified line at top of page (default)
