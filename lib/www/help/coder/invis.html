<pre> 
   Type:        command
   Usage:       invis
                
   Description: The command 'invis' is a God command that is used to render 
		one invisible to mortals.  That means that you will not show 
		up on the 'who' list for them.  You will still be visible to 
		other Immortals, but you will have '()' around your name, 
		signifing that you are invisible.
 
   Example:     &gt; invis
		You are now invisible.
