<pre>
   Type:        command
   Usage:       prepare spells &lt;number&gt;
                
   Description: This command allows you to set the time how long you wish to
		prepare a spell, how long you want to focus on its magic, 
		before freeing the energies. It's very difficult to overcast,
		i.e. cast beyond your personal abilities, and therefore you
		should never overcast spells without enough preparation time.
		You better spend the time to handle magic carefully.
		As a simple rule one can say, overcasting needs at least 2
		rounds of preparation time, while casting a spell 6-7 levels
		below your knowlegde needs no preparation time. But this is 
		only an advice. You better prepare yourself always if you got
		the time.
 
   Example:     prepare spells 0
		prepare spells 1
		prepare spells 2
