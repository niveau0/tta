<h3>The Third Age - Help <i>realms</i></h3>

<pre>
   There are four realms of magic.

   'cha' - This is the power of the deities channeled to the world through 
           their followers.  It is all of religious nature and independent
           of the essence. Channeling power from the deity doesn't require
           the direct  cooperation of  the deity.  But acting  against the
           goals and nature of the clerics religion may lead to innability
           to cast.

   'ess' - The power directly drawn from the essence that is all around. 
           Therefore  'ess' spells are  almost elemental in nature (fire-,
           earth-, water-, wind- or lightbased, etc.).  Inert material as
           metal armor increases the difficulty in manipulating the essence.

   'men' - Powers drawn from the essence and channeled through the mind of
           the magic user. 'men' is very  personal power.  Spells from the 
           mind interfere with head cover (like helmets).
           
   'arc' - The ancient knowledge of magic, the ways of the arcane mage, are 
           mostly unknown.  But it is said  that arcane  magic combines the
           three realms 'cha', 'ess', 'men' and this was the origin of magic
           before it was split.  Arcane  mages could draw  their power from
           every source.
