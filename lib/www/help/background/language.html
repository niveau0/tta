<h3>The Third Age - Help <i>language</i></h3>

<pre>
   When, during the  first age, the   elves moved on their  great wandering
   to  the  west, some never crossed  the   Blue Mountains, some  stayed in
   Beleriand, others moved to Valinor only to return later on. The language
   of the elves reflect those three splittings: 
    The Dark-Elves or Avari, the Silvan elves, use  to speak the Wood-Elven 
   tongue, the so called Silvan dialect, the Gray-Elves or Sindar speak the
   Sindarin, while the  Noldor speek Quenya, the high language of the West.
   But upon their return to  Beleriand this language was abonded except for 
   poetry.

   The  humans had   no  common language in  the  beginning,  some of their
   languages were completely  different.  At least 4  groups are known: The  
   Edain, the  Dunlander, the Druedain and some  people  from the south and
   east.  The people of the south advanced to Bree, the people of the North
   settled beyond the eastern and western parts  of the Darkforest and thus
   were seperated from those who moved to Beleriand:
    The Edain. As long as the Edain were in Beleriand, they spoke Sindarin,
   upon moving to Numenor during the second  age they abandonded the elvish
   language and began  to develop Adunaic, the language  of the third house
   of  the  people of  Dor-lomin,   mixed with parts   of  Sindarin. In the
   colonies around the Bay of Belfalas this language soon got mixed up with 
   the tongue of the southern folk from the mountains. During the third age
   this mixture became known as Westron, the common language. It became the
   language spoken by  nearly everyone within the  boundaries of Arnor  and
   Gondor.

   Following is a table displaying the relations between the known and most
   used languages:
