<pre>
  The following races are available if you want to play  a character in the
  virtual world of TTA. 

  Articman -- Humans from the far north. They still speak somewhat Adunaic.

  Dunedan  -- The descendants of the Numenoreans. The high men that were once
              called lords of the humans.
  Dwarf    -- They live in huge caves. During the third age they already lost
              their greatest town, Khazad-Dum, now Moria.
  Hobbit   -- Hobbits are very small and can hide very well. They are very 
              resistant like the dwarves.
  Halfelf  -- The rare people that have an elf and a human as parents. There
              are very few half elves.
  Noldo    -- The descendents of the high elves, from the blessed lands. The
              Noldor nearly vanished from middleearth.
  Northman -- Another race of the northern regions, living among the hobbits
              of Eriador.
  Sinda    -- The grey elves, their ancestors were the elves of Doriath in 
              Beleriand.
  Woodelf  -- Decendants of the Avari, the dark elves. During the third age
              most elves in middleearth belong to the Avari.
  Variag   -- Human people coming from the east of middleearth.
