<pre>
   There are various way to express something:

   grumble        --    To express something you are not happy about or the
                        usual way dwarven voices sound.

   mumble         --    Partially talking to  yourself, similar to thinking 
                        aloud.

   say            --    The usual way to talk.

   shout          --    Express yourself in your most effective loudness.

   shriek         --    Yelling in a high-pitched tone, usually if  you are 
                        surprised by something.

   sing           --    To talk in  a very melodic way,  associated to  the
                        speech of the elves.

   Take care, whatever you say can and will be  heard by people surrounding
   you, if they are too far away they may not understand you.
