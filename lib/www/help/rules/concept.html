<pre>
   The Third Age's (TTA) concept:

      A mud can take  on many forms. However,  the common feature shared by
   all muds is the ability for  many people to interact  within the game at
   the same time.  MUD is the acronym  for Multi User  Dungeon. As the name
   implies, the first  muds were set in a  fantasy environment; even though
   many still are, it is far from  the only environment possible. What kind
   of world you play in is entirely up to the administrators of the game to
   decide.  It can be anything  from a science  fiction universe in the far
   future to a  medieval world with castles  and  dungeons. This particular
   world, TTA, is set  in a medieval fantasy  environment (based mostly  on
   Tolkien`s Middelearth).

     You play the role of an adventurer - as you explore the world you will
   meet other adventurers set out to complete quests, engage in combat,  or
   just to meet new people.

      It  is up to you  to  choose your  friends  and enemies. As you treat
   others, they are likely to treat  you. Some creatures  may prove hard to
   deal with and  some might be  willing to trade.  A few will flee as  you
   approach while others will stay and fight.  As you gain experience as an
   adventurer you will get better at the skills that you choose to practise.
   Whether to wield powerful magic or lethal weapons, is again your choice.

   An important part to keep in mind:

                 TTA should be a *roleplaying* environment.

   To clarify this:

     The virtual person you play should interact like a person fitting into
   a medieval fantasy time.  You shouldn't  meet  somewhere and talk  about
   things that would be unknown to your character. There is no place inside
   TTA for discussions about the latest movies or rock concerts.

     If you really need to discuss something 'out-of-character'   according
   to the 'real-life', you  should  visit  a special area  (OOC-area)  that
   exists outside  the game's world, so you  won`t spoil the atmosphere for
   the other players around.

     A group of people  seriously talking about  a plan  to fight  the huge
   dragon don't need someone, who always wants to state that the monster is
   a non-player-character (npc), computer steered living, and so he/she can
   be fooled  somehow. This knowledge is not  available to the _adventurer_
   you are playing.

   This is an advice, but strict anti-roleplay will be punished.
