<pre>   
   This game should be a fantasy roleplay environment.  You can play a vir-
   tual character in a medieval world, where monsters and magic are common.
   But to ensure that this virtual world has a fantasy atmosphere, everyone
   must follow some simple rules. While playing you  should not forget your 
   role, otherwise the feeling is disturbed. A knight  won't talk about the
   number of players in the  game, he might have the  problem where to find
   an inn. You should try to seperate your and your characters knowledge.
