Chapter 6: Variable Handling
</font>
</h4>
</center>

<h4>6.1 Review</h4>
By now you should be able to code some simple objects using your muds
standard object library.  Inheritance allows you to use functions defined
in those objects without having to go and define yourself.  In addition,
you should know how to declare your own functions.  This chapter will teach
you about the basic elements of LPC which will allow you to define your own
functions using the manipulation of variables.

<h4>6.2 Values and objects</h4>

Basically, what makes objects on the mud different are two things:
<ul>
<li>Some have different functions
<li>All have different values
</ul>

Now, all player objects have the same functions.  They are therefore
differentiated by the values they hold.  For instance, the player named
"Forlock" is different from "Descartes" <i>at least</i> in that they have
different values for the variable <i>name</i>, those being "descartes" and
"forlock".
<p>
Therefore, changes in the game involve changes in the values of the objects
in the game.  Functions are used to name specific process for manipulating
values.  For instance, the <code>create()</code> function is the function
whose process is specifically to initialize the values of an object.
Within a function, it is specifically things called instructions which are
responsible for the direct manipulation of variables.

<h4>6.3 Local and global variables</h4>

Like variables in most programming language, LPC variables may be declared
as variables "local" to a specific function, or "globally" available
to all functions.  Local variables are declared inside the function which
will use them.  No other function knows about their existence, since
the values are only stored in memory while that function is being executed.
A global variable is available to any function which comes after its
declaration in the object code.  Since global variables take up RAM for
the entire existence of the object, you should use them only when
you need a value stored for the entire existence of the object.
Have a look at the following 2 bits of code:
<pre>
int x;

int 
query_x()
{
    return x; 
}

void 
set_x(int y)
{
    x = y; 
}

--------------------

void 
set_x(int y)
{
    int x;

    x = y;
    write("x is set to x"+x+" and will now be forgotten.\n");
}
</pre>

In the first example, x is declared 'outside' of any functions, and therefore
will be available to any function declared after it.  In that example,
x is a <b>global</b> variable.
<p>
In the second example, x is declared inside the function
<code>set_x()</code>.  It only exists while the function
<code>set_x()</code> is being executed.  Afterwards, it ceases to exist.
In that example, x is a <b>local</b> variable.

<h4>6.4 Manipulating the values of variables</h4>

Instructions to the driver are used to manipulate the values of variables.
An example of an instruction would be:
<pre>
x = 5;
</pre>

The above instruction is self-explanatory.  It assigns to the variable
x the value 5.  However, there are some important concepts in involved
in that instruction which are involved in instructions in general.
The first involves the concept of an expression.  An expression is
any series of symbols which have a value.  In the above instruction,
the variable x is assigned the value of the expression 5.  Constant
values are the simplest forms in which expressions can be put.  A constant
is a value that never changes like the <i>int</i> 5 or the <i>string</i>
"hello". The last concept is the concept of an operator.  In the above
example, the assignment operator = is used.
<p>
There are however many more operators in LPC, and expressions can get
quite complex.  If we go up one level of complexity, we get:
<pre>
y = 5;
x = y + 2;
</pre>

The first instruction uses the assignment operator to assign the value
of the constant expression 5 to the variable y.  The second one
uses the assignment operator to assign to x the value of the expression
(y+2) which uses the addition operator to come up with a value which
is the sum of the value of y and the value of the constant expression 2.
Sound like a lot of hot air?
<p>
In another manner of speaking, operators can be used to form complex
expressions.  In the above example, there are two expressions in the
one instruction <code>x = y + 2;</code>
<ul>
<li>the expression <code>y + 2</code>
<li>the expression <code>x = y + 2</code>
</ul>

As stated before, all expressions have a value.  The expression y+2 has the
value of the sum of y and 2 (here, 7); The expression x = y + 2 <i>also</i>
has the value of 7. So operators have two important tasks:
<ol>
<li>They <i>may</i> act upon input like a function.
<li>They evaluate as having a value themselves.
</ol>

Now, not all operators do what 1 does.  The = operators does act upon
the value of 7 on its right by assigning that value to x.  The operator
+ however does nothing.  They both, however, have their own values.

<h4>6.5 Complex expressions</h4>

As you may have noticed above, the expression x = 5 <i>itself</i> has a value
of 5.  In fact, since LPC operators themselves have value as expressions,
they can allow you to write some really convoluted looking nonsense like:
<pre>
i = ( (x = sizeof(tmp = users())) 
       ? --x 
       : sizeof(tmp = children("/std/monster")) - 1)
</pre>

which says basically:
<p>
assing to tmp the array returned by the efun <code>users()</code>, then
assign to x the value equal to the number of elements to that array.  If
the value of the expression assigning the value to x is true (not 0), then
assign x by 1 and assign the value of x-1 to i.  If x is false though,
then set tmp to the array returned by the efun <code>children()</code>, and
then assign to i the value of the number of members in the array tmp - 1.
<p>
Would you ever use the above statement? I doubt it.  However you might
see or use expressions similar to it, since the ability to consolidate
so much information into one single line helps to speed up the execution of
your code.  A more often used version of this property of LPC operators
would be something like:
<pre>
x = sizeof(tmp = users());
while(i--) 
    write((string)tmp[i]->query_name() + "\n");
</pre>
instead of writing something like:
<pre>
tmp = users();
x = sizeof(tmp);
for(i=0; i&lt;x; i++)
     write((string)tmp[i]->query_name() + "\n");
</pre>

Things like <code>for(), while()</code>, arrays and such will be explained
later. But the first bit of code is more concise and it executed faster.
<p>
<b>Note</b>:
<p>
A detailed description of basic LPC operators follows the chapter summary.

<h4>6.6 Chapter Summary</h4>

You now know how to declare variables and understand the difference between
declaring and using them globally or locally.  Once you become familiar
with your driver's efuns, you can display those values in many different
ways.  In addition, through the LPC operators, you know how to change
and evaluate the values contained in variables.  This is useful of course
in that it allows you to do something like count how many apples have
been picked from a tree, so that once all apples have been picked, no
players can pick more.  Unfortunately, you do not know how to have
code executed in anything other than a linear fashion.  In other words,
hold off on that apple until the next chapter, cause you do not know
how to check if the apples picked is equal to the number of apples in the
tree.  You also do not know about the special function <code>init()</code>
where you give new commands to players [Not in TTA-Mudlib, ed.].  But you
are almost ready to code a nice, fairly complex area.

<h4>6.7 LPC operators</h4>

This section contains a detailed listing of the simpler LPC operators,
including what they do to the values they use (if anything) and the value
that they have.
<p>
The operators described here are:
<pre>
=     +     -     *     /    %    +=    -=    *=   /=    %=
--    ++    ==    !=    >    <    >=    <=    !    &&    ||
->    ?:
</pre>

Those operators are all described in a rather dry manner below, but it is best
to at least look at each one, since some may not behave <i>exactly</i> as
you think.  But it should make a rather good reference guide.

<tr>
<th>Symbol

</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>=
<td align=center>assignment
<td align=center>x = 5
<td>It takes the value of any expression on the right and assigns it to the
variable on the left.  Note that you must use a single variable on the
left, as you cannot assign values to constants or complex expressions.
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>+
<td align=center>addition
<td align=center>x + 7
<td>It takes the value of the expression on the right and adds it to the
value of the expression on the left. For values of type <i>int</i>, this
means the numerical sum.  For <i>strings</i>, it means that they are
concatenaded ("ab" is the value of "a" + "b").
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>-
<td align=center>subtraction
<td align=center>x - 3
<td>Same characteristics as addition, except it subtracts. With strings:
"a" is the value of "ab" - "b" [This does not work with DGD, ed.].
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>*
<td align=center>multiplication
<td align=center>x * 7
<td>Same as with adding and subtracting except that it does not work for
strings.

<td align=center>x % 4
<td>Same as with division, except it gives the division remainder.
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>+=
<td align=center>additive assignment
<td align=center>x += 3
<td>It takes the value of the variable on the left and the value of the
expression on the right, adds them together and assigns the sum to the
variable on the left. According to the example, if x was 2, x will be 5.
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>-=
<td align=center>subtraction assignment
<td align=center>x -= 3

<td>Same as with /=, except it gives the division remainder.
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>++
<td align=center>post/pre-increment
<td align=center>x++<br>++x
<td>++ changes the value (here of x) by increasing it by 1. However, the
value of the expression depends on where you place the ++.  ++x is the
pre-increment operator.  This means that it performs the increment
<i>before</i> giving a value. x++ is the post-increment operator.  It
evalutes before incrementing x.

If either are false, then the result is false.
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>||
<td align=center>logical Or
<td align=center>x || y
<td>Same as with &&, except only one of the values must be true for it to
evaluate as true.  It is only false if both values indeed are false.
</tr>

<td align=center>?:
<td align=center>conditional 
<td align=center>x ? y : z
<td>If the leftmost value (here x) is true it will evaluate the expression
to the value of the middle (here y), else to the rightmost (here z).

<p>
A note on equality:
<p>
A very nasty error people make, that is often difficult to debug, is the
error of placing a = symbol where you mean ==.  Since operators return
values, they both make sense when being evaluated. In other words, no error
occurs.  But they have very different values.  For example:
<p>
<pre>
if(x == 5) 

if(x = 5)
</pre>
<p>
The value of x == 5 is true if the value of x is 5, false otherwise.<br>
The value of x = 5 is 5 (and therefore always true).
<p>
The if statement is looking for the expression in ( ) to be either true or
false, so if you had = and meant ==, you would end up with an expression
that is always true.  And you would pull your hair out trying to figure out
why things were not happening like they should :)
