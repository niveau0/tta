Chapter 7: Flow Control
</font>
</h4>
</center>

<h4>7.1 Review of variables</h4>

Variables may be manipulated by assigning or changing values with the
expressions =, +=, -=, ++, --.  Those expressions may be combined with
the expressions -, +, *, /, %.  However, so far, you have only been
shown how to use a function to do these in a linear way.  For example:
<pre>
int
hello(int x) 
{
    x--;
    write("Hello, x is " + x + ".\n");
    return x;
}
</pre>
 
is a function you should know how to write and understand.  But what
if you wanted to write the value of x only if x = 1?  Or what if
you wanted it to keep writing x over and over until x = 1 before
returning?  LPC uses flow control in exactly the same way as C and C++.
<p>

<h4>7.2 The LPC flow control statements</h4>

LPC uses the following expressions:
<pre>
if(expression) 
    instruction;

if(expression) 
    instruction;
else
    instruction;
 
if(expression) 
    instruction;
else if(expression)
    instruction;
else 
    instruction;
 
while(expression) 
    instruction;
 
do 
{ 
    instruction; 
} while(expression);
 
for (initialize values; test expression; instruction)
{  
    instructions 
}

switch(expression) 
{
  case constant:
      instruction; 
      break;
  default:
      instruction;
}
</pre> 

Before we discuss these, first something on what is meant by expression and
instruction.  An expression is anything with a value like a variable,
a comparison (like x &gt; 5, where if x is 6 or more, the value is 1, else the
value is 0), or an assignment (like x += 2).  An instruction can be any
single line of lpc code like a function call, a value assignment or
modification, etc.
<p> 
You should know also the operators &&, ||, ==, !=, and !.  These are the
logical operators.  They return a nonzero value when true, and 0 when false.
Make note of the values of the following expressions:
<pre>
(1 && 1)    value: 1  	(1 and 1)
(1 && 0)    value: 0  	(1 and 0)
(1 || 0)    value: 1  	(1 or 0)
(1 == 1)    value: 1  	(1 is equal to 1)
(1 != 1)    value: 0  	(1 is not equal to 1)
(!1)        value: 0  	(not 1)
(!0)        value: 1  	(not 0)
</pre>
 
In expressions using &&, if the value of the first item being compared
is 0, the second is never tested even.  When using ||, if the first is
true (1), then the second is not tested.
 
<h4>7.3 if()</h4>

The first expression to look at that alters flow control is <b>if()</b>.
Take a look at the following example: 
<p>
<pre>
 1  void 
 2  reset() 
 3  {
 4 	int x;
 5 
 6 	::reset();
 7 	x = random(100);
 8 	if (x > 50) 
 9 	    set_search_func("floorboards", "search_floor");
10  }
</pre>
 
The line numbers are for reference only.<p>

Line 4, a variable is declared (of type int called x).<br>
Line 5 is aesthetic whitespace to clearly show where the declarations end
and the function code begins.  The variable x is only available to the
function reset().<br>
Line 6 makes a call to the room.c version of reset().<br>
Line 7 uses the driver efun random() to return a random number between
0 and the parameter minus 1.  So here we are looking for a number between
0 and 99.<br>
Line 8, we test the value of the expression (x > 50) to see if it is true
or false.  If it is true, then it makes a call to the room.c function
set_search_func().  If it is false, the call to set_search_func() is never
executed.<br>
Line 10 is the end of the function and returns driver control to the
calling function (the driver itself in this case) without returning any value.
<p>
If you had wanted to execute multiple instructions instead of just the one,
you would have done it in the following manner:
<pre>
if (x > 50) 
{
    set_search_func("floorboards", "search_floor");
    if (!present("beggar", this_object()))
        make_beggar();
}
</pre>
Notice the { } encapsulate the instructions to be executed if the test
expression is true.  In the example, again we call the room.c function.
<p>
Next, there is another if() expression that tests the truth of the
expression (!present("beggar",this_object())). The ! in the test expression
negates the truth of the expression which follows it.  In this case, it
changes the truth of the efun present(), which will return the object that
is a beggar if it is in the room (this_object()), or it will return 0 if
there is no beggar in the room.
<p>
So if there is a beggar still living in the room, (present("beggar",
this_object())) will have a value equal to the beggar object (data type
object), otherwise it will be 0.  The ! will change a 0 to a 1, or any
nonzero value (like the beggar object) to a 0. Therefore, the expression
(!present("beggar", this_object())) is true if there is no beggar in the
room, and false if there is. 
<p>
So, if there is no beggar in the room, then it calls the function you
define in your room code that makes a new beggar and puts it in the
room (If there is a beggar in the room, we do not want to add yet another
one :).
<p> 
Of course, if() often comes with ands or buts :).  In LPC, the formal
reading of the if() statement is:
<pre>
if (expression) 
{ 
    set of instructions 
}
else if (expression) 
{
    set of instructions 
}
else 
{
    set of instructions 
}
</pre>
 
This means:
<p> 
If expression is true, then do these instructions. Otherwise, if this
second expression is true, do this second set. And if none of those were
true, then do this last set.
<p> 
You can use if() alone:
<pre>
if (x > 5)
    write("Foo.\n");
</pre>
with an else if():
<pre>
if (x > 5)
    write("X is greater than 5.\n");
else if (x > 2)
    write("X is less than 6, but greater than 2.\n");
</pre>
or the whole lot of them as listed above.  You can have any number of
else if()'s in the expression, but you must have one and only one
if() and at most one else.  Of course, as with the beggar example,
you may nest if() statements inside if() instructions.
 
<h4>7.4 The statements: while() and do {} while()</h4>

Syntax:
<pre>
while(expression) 
{
    set of instructions 
}

do 
{
    set of instructions
} while(expression);
</pre>
 
These allow you to create a set of instructions which continue to execute
so long as some expression is true.  Suppose you wanted to set a variable
equal to a player's level and keep subtracting random amounts of either
money or hit points from a player until that variable equals 0 (so that
player's of higher levels would lose more).  You might do it this way:
 
<pre>
 1  int x;
 2
 3  x = (int)this_player()->query_level(); /* this has yet to be explained */
 4  while(x > 0)
 5  {
 6      if (random(2))
 7          this_player()->add_money("silver", -random(50));
 8      else 
 9          this_player()->add_hp(-(random(10));
10      x--;
11  }
</pre>
 
The expression this_player()->query_level() in line 3 is a mudlib dependent
thing (here it get the players level and puts the value in x).
<p>
In line 4, we start a loop that executes so long as x is greater than 0.
Another way we could have done this line would be:
<pre>
while(x) {
</pre>
This would run as long as x is true (not zero). The problem with that would
be if you later made a change to the function and x gets somehow a value
below 0 (which is also true and the loop would run forever).<br>
In line 6, a random value of 0 or 1 is taken to determine if the player
should lose money or hitpoints. If the random value is true (in this case
1) the player will lose money (line 7), else he will lose a random value of
hitpoints (line 9).<br>
In line 10, x is decreased by 1, so the loop will run again as long as x is
not 0.
<p> 
You might, however, want to test an expression <i>after</i> you execute the
loop body at least one time.  For instance, in the above, if you wanted to
execute the instructions at least once for everyone, even if their level is
below the test level:
<pre> 
int x;

x = (int)this_player()->query_level();
do 
{
    if (random(2)) 
        this_player()->add_money("silver", -random(50));
    else 
        this_player()->add_hp(-random(10));
    x--;
} while(x > 0);
</pre>
 
This is a rather bizarre example, being as few muds have level 0 players.
And even still, you could have done it using the original loop with
a different test.  Nevertheless, it is intended to show how a do { } while()
works.
<p>
As you see, instead of initiating the test at the beginning of the
loop (which would immediately exclude some values of x), it tests after
the loop has been executed.  This assures that the instructions of the loop
get executed at least one time, no matter what x is.
 
<h4>7.5 for() loops</h4>

Syntax:
<pre>
for (initialize values; test expression; instruction) 
{
    instructions 
}
</pre>
 
<i>initialize values:</i><br>
This allows you to set starting values of variables which will be used
in the loop.  This part is optional.
<p> 
<i>test expression:</i><br>
Same as the expression in if() and while().  The loop is executed
as long as this expression (or expressions) is true. You must have a
test expression.
<p> 
<i>instruction:</i><br>
An expression (or expressions) which is to be executed at the end of each
loop.  This is optional.
<p> 
<i>Note:</i>
<pre>
for(; expression; ) 
{
}

is exactly the same as

while(expression) 
{
}
</pre>

Example:
<pre>
1  int x;
2
3  for(x=(int)this_player()->query_level(); x&gt;; x--) 
4  {
5      if (random(2)) 
6          this_player()->add_money("silver", -random(50));
7      else 
8          this_player()->add_hp(-random(10));
9  }
</pre>
 
This for() loop behaves <i>exactly</i> like the while() example.
Additionally, if you wanted to initialize 2 variables:
<pre>
for(x=0, y=random(20); x&lt;; x++) 
{
    write(x+"\n"); 
}
</pre>
Here, we initialize 2 variables, x and y, and we separate them by a
comma.  You can do the same with any of the 3 parts of the for()
expression.
<p>
 
<h4>7.6 The statement: switch()</h4>

Syntax:
<pre>
switch(expression) 
{
  case constant:
      instructions
  case constant: 
      instructions
  case constant:
      instructions
  default: 
      instructions
}
</pre>
 
This is functionally much like if() expressions, and much nicer to the
CPU, however most rarely used because it looks so complicated. But it is not.
<p> 
First off, the expression is not a test.  The cases are tests.  A English
sounding way to read:
<pre>
 1  int x;
 2
 3  x = random(5);
 4  switch(x) 
 5  {
 6    case 1:
 7        write("X is 1.\n");
 8    case 2:
 9        x++;
10    default: 
11        x--;
12  }
13  write(x+"\n");
</pre>
is like:
<p> 
set variable x to a random number between 0 and 4.<br>
In case 1 of variable x write its value, add 1 to it and subtract 1.<br>
In case 2 of variable x, add 1 to its value and then subtract 1.<br>
In other cases subtract 1.<br>
Write the value of x.
<p>
switch(x) basically tells the driver that the variable x is the value
we are trying to match to a case.
<p>
Once the driver finds a case which matches, that case <i>and all following
cases</i> will be acted upon.  You may break out of the switch statement
as well as any other flow control statement with a <i>break</i> instruction in
order only to execute a single case.  But that will be explained later.
The default statement is one that will be executed for any value of
x so long as the switch() flow has not been broken. 
 
<h4>7.7 Altering the flow of functions and flow control statements</h4>

The instructions <i>return, continue, break</i> alter the natural flow of
things as described above.
<p>
<i>return</i>
<p>
no matter where it occurs in a function, will cease the execution of that
function and return control to the function which called the one the
return statement is in.  If the function is <i>not</i> of type void, then a
value must follow the return statement, and that value must be of a
type matching the function.  An absolute value function would look
like this:
<pre>
int 
absolute_value(int x) 
{
    if (x>-1)
        return x;
    else
        return -x;
}
</pre>
 
In the second line, the function ceases execution and returns to the calling
function because the desired value has been found if x is a positive
number.
<p> 
<i>continue</i>
<p>
is most often used in for() and while statements.  It serves to stop the
execution of the current loop and send the execution back to the beginning
of the loop.  For instance, say you wanted to avoid division by 0:
<pre>
x = 4;
while(x > -5) 
{
    x--;
    if (!x)
        continue;
    write((100 / x) + "\n");
}
write("Done.\n")
</pre>

If x ever gets 0, it is catched by the if() and execution is passed again
to the loops beginning, without executing the division.
<p>
<i>break</i>
<p>
This one ceases the function of a flow control statement.  No matter
where you are in the statement, the control of the program will go
to the end of the loop.  So, if in the above examples, we had
used <i>break</i> instead of <i>continue</i>, the output would have stopped
after x reached 0 and the execution would continue with the "Done" output.
 
<h4>7.8 Chapter summary</h4>
This chapter covered one hell of a lot, but it was stuff that needed to
be seen all at once.  You should now completely understand if(), for(),
while(), do{} while() and switch(), as well as how to alter their flow
using <i>return, continue,</i> and <i>break</i>.  Effeciency says if it can
be done in a natural way using switch() instead of a lot of if() else
if()'s, then by all means do it.  You were also introduced to the idea of
calling functions in other objects.  That however, is a topic to be
detailed later. You now should be completely at ease writing simple rooms
(if you have read your mudlib's room building document), simple monsters,
and other sorts of simple objects.
