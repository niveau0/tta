Chapter 2: The LPC Program
</font>
</h4>
</center>

<h4>2.1 About programs</h4>

The title of this chapter of the textbook is actually poorly named, since
one does not write programs in LPC.  An LPC coder instead writes
<b>objects</b>. 
What is the difference?  Well, for our purposes now, the difference is
in the way the file is executed.  When you "run" a program, execution
begins at a definite place in the program.  In other words, there
is a place in all programs that is noted as the beginning where program
execution starts.  In addition, programs have definite end points,
so that when execution reaches that point, the execution of the program
terminates.  So, in short, execution of a program runs from a definite
beginning point through to a definite end point.  This is not so with
LPC objects.
<p>
With muds, LPC objects are simply distinct parts of the C program which
is running the game (the driver).  In other words, execution of the mud
program begins and ends in the driver.  But the driver in fact does
very little in the way of creating the world you know when you play
a mud.  Instead, the driver relies heavily on the code created in LPC,
executing lines of the objects in the mud as needed.  LPC objects thus
have no place that is necessarily the beginning point, nor do they
have a definite ending point.
<p>
Like other programming languages, an LPC "program" may be made up of
one or more files.  For an LPC object to get executed, it simple
needs to be loaded into the driver's memory.  The driver will call lines
from the object as it needs according to a structure which will be
defined throughout this textbook.  The important thing you need to
understand at this point is that there is no "beginning" to an LPC
object in terms of execution, and there is no "end".
<p>

<h4>2.2 Driver-mudlib interaction</h4>

As I have mentioned earlier, the driver is the C program that runs on
the host machine.  It connects you into the game and processes LPC code.
Note that this is one theory of mud programming, and not necessarily
better than others.  It could be that the entire game is written in C.
Such a game would be much faster, but it would be less flexible in
that wizards could not add things to the game while it was running. This
is the theory behind DikuMUDs.  Instead, LPMUDs run on the theory that
the driver should in no define the nature of the game, that the nature
of the game is to be decided by the individuals involved, and that
you should be able to add to the game <i>as it is being played</i>.  This
is why LPMUDs make use of the LPC programming language.  It allows
you to define the nature of the game in LPC for the driver to read and
execute as needed.  It is also a much simpler language to understand
than C, thus making the process of world creation open to a greater
number of people.
<p>
Once you have written a file in LPC (assuming it is corrent LPC), it justs
sits there on the host machine's hard drive until something in the game
makes reference to it.  When something in the game finally does make
reference to the object, a copy of the file is loaded into memory and
a special <b>function</b> of that object is called in order to initialize
the values of the variables in the object.  Now, do not be concerned
if that last sentence went right over your head, since someone brand
new to programming would not know what the hell a function or a variable
is.  The important thing to understand right now is that a copy of the
object file is taken by the driver from the machine's hard drive and
stored into memory (since it is a copy, multiple versions of that
object may exist).  You will later understand what a function is, what
a variable is, and exactly how it is something in the game made reference
to your object.
<p>

<h4>2.3 Loading an object into memory</h4>

Although there is no particular place in an object code that must exist
in order for the driver to begin executing it, there is a place for which
the driver will search in order to initialize the object.  On DGD it is
freely configurable [on TTA it is the function called _F_create(), ed.].
<p>
LPC objects are made up of variables (values which can change) and
functions which are used to manipulate those variables.  Functions
manipulate variables through the use of LPC grammatical structures,
which include calling other functions, using externally defined
functions (kfuns, kernel functions), and basic LPC expressions and flow
control mechanisms.
<p>
Does that sound convoluted?  First lets start with a variable.  A
variable name might be something like <i>level</i>, containing the player's
level.  It can "vary" from situation to situation in value, and different
things use the value of the player's level to make different things happen.
For instance, if you are a level 19 player, the value of the variable level
will be 19.  Now if your mud is on the old LPMud 2.4.5 system where levels
1-19 are players and 20+ are wizards, things can ask for your level value to
see if you can perform wizard type actions.  Basically, each object
in LPC is a pile of variables with values which change over time.
Things happen to these objects based on what values its variables
hold.  Often, then things that happen cause the variables to change.
<p>
So, whenever an object in LPC is referenced by another object currently
in memory, the driver searches to see what places for values the
object has (but they have no values yet).  Once that is done, the driver
calls the initial function (mentioned above, depending on your driver)
which will set up the starting values for the object's variables.  It is
thus through <b>calls</b> to <b>functions</b> that variable values get
manipulated. 
<p>
<i><b>
<font color="#007744">
About the initial function on TTA<br>
</font>
</b>
_F_create() is used on TTA to initialize the basic values, _F_create then
calls function create() which can be used by your object to initialize your
own defined variables. It is only called once.
</i>
<p>
But the initial function is <i>not</i> the starting place of LPC code, although
it is where most LPC code execution does begin.  The fact is, those
functions need not exist.  If your object does just fine with its
starting values all being <i>null</i> pointers (meaning, for our purposes
here, 0), then you do not need an initial function.  Thus the first bit of
execution of the object's code may begin somewhere completely different.
<p>
Now we get to what this chapter is all about.
<p>
Question: <i>What consists a complete LPC object?</i>
<p>
Well, an LPC object is simply one or more functions grouped together
manipulating 0 or more variables. Also important to note, an object
containing only an empty function like: 
<pre>
void
nonsense() 
{
}
</pre>
or simply nothing, is a valid, but trivial object, although it probably
would not interact properly with other objects on your mud since such an
object has no weight, is invisible, etc..
<p>

<h4>2.4 Chapter summary</h4>

LPC code has no beginning point or ending point, since LPC code is used
to create objects to be used by the driver program rather than create
individual programs.  LPC objects consist of one or more functions whose
order in the code is irrelevant, as well as of zero or more variables whose
values are manipulated inside those functions.  LPC objects simply sit
on the host machine's hard driver until referenced by another object in
the game (in other words, they do not really exist).  Once the object
is referenced, it is loaded into the machine's memory with empty
values for the variables.  The initial function is called in that object, if
it exists, to allow the variables to take on initial values.  Other
functions in the object are used by the driver and other objects in the
game to allow interaction among objects and the manipulation of the LPC
variables.
