<h4>4.1 Review</h4>

By this point, you should be aware that LPC objects consist of functions
which manipulate variables.  The functions manipulate variables when they
are executed, and they get executed through <i>calls</i> to those functions.
The order in which the functions are placed in a file does not matter.
Inside a function, the variables get manipulated.  They are stored in
computer memory and used by the computer as 0's and 1's which
get translated to and from useable output and input through a device
called data typing.  <i>String</i> data types tell the driver that the
data should appear to you and come from you in the form of alphanumeric
characters.  Variables of type <i>int</i> are represented to you as whole
number values.  Type <i>status</i> is represented to you as either 1 or 0.
And finally type <i>void</i> has no value to you or the machine, and is not
really used with variable data types.

<h4>4.2 What is a function?</h4>
Like math functions, LPC functions take input and return output.
Languages like Pascal distinguish between the concept of procedure and
the concept of function.  LPC does not, however, it is useful to
understand this distinction.  What Pascal calls a procedure, LPC
calls a function of type <i>void</i>.  In other words, a procedure, or function
of type void returns no output.  What Pascal calls a function differs
in that it does return output.  In LPC, the most trivial, correct
function is:
<pre>
void
do_nothing() 
{ 
}
</pre>
This function accepts no input, performs no instructions, and returns no
value.
<p>
There are three parts to every properly written LPC function:
<ol>
<li>The declaration
<li>The definition
<li>The call
</ol>

Like with variables, functions must be declared.  This will allow the
driver to know
<ul>
<li>what type of data the function is returning as output,
<li>how many input(s) and of what type those input(s) are.  The
more common word for input is parameters.
</ul>
A <b>function declaration</b> therefore consists of
<pre>
type name(parameter1, parameter2, ..., parameterN);
</pre>
The declaration of a function called <code>drink_water()</code>
which accepts a <i>string</i> as input and an <i>int</i> as output would
thus look like 
<pre>
int drink_water(string str);
</pre>

where 'str' is the name of the input as it will be used inside the function.
[The DGD driver only needs function declaration if you call a function whose
definition appears after the calling functions code, ed.]
<p>
The <b>function definition</b> is the code which describes what the
function actually does with the input sent to it.  
<p>
The call is any place in other functions which invokes the execution of the
function in question.  For two functions <code>write_vals()</code> and
<code>add()</code>, you thus might have the following bit of code:
<pre>
/* First, function declarations (also called prototypes)
 * They usually appear at the beginning of object code,
 * to let the driver know of their later existence.
 */
void write_vals();
int add(int x, int y);

/* Next, the definition of the function write_vals().  
 * We assume that this function is going to be called
 * from outside the object.
 */
void 
write_vals() 
{
    int x;

    /* Now we assign x the value of the output of add() through a call */
    x = add(2, 2);
    write(x + "\n");
}

/* Finally, the definition of add() */
int 
add(int x, int y) 
{
    return (x + y);
}
</pre>

Remember, it does not matter which function definition appears first in the
code.  This is because functions are not executed consecutively.  Instead,
functions are executed as called.  The only requirement is that the
declaration of a function appear before its definition and before the
definition of any function which makes a call to it.

<h4>4.3 Efuns</h4>

Perhaps you have heard people refer to efuns [kfuns on DGD, ed.].  They are
externally defined functions.  Namely, they are defined by the mud driver.
If you have played around at all with coding in LPC, you have probably
found some expressions you were told to use like <code>this_player(),
write(), say(), this_object()</code>, etc.  That is because they are efuns.
The value of efuns is that they are much faster than LPC functions, since
they already exist in the binary form the computer understands. 
<p>
In the function <code>write_vals()</code> above, two function calls were
made.  The first was to the function <code>add()</code>, which you declared
and defined.<br>
The second call, however, was to a function called <code>write()</code>,
and efun.  The driver has already declared and defined this function for 
you.  You needs only to make calls to it. [<code>write()</code> does not
exist on TTA, ed.] 
<p>
Efuns are created to handle common, every day function calls, to handle
input/output to the internet sockets and other matters difficult to be
dealt with in LPC.  They are written in C in the game driver and compiled
along with the driver before the mud comes up, making them much faster
in execution.  But for your purposes, efun calls are just like calls
made to your functions.<p>
Still, it is important to know two things of any efun
<ul>
<li>what return type does it have,
<li>what parameters of what types does it take.
</ul>

Information on efuns such as input parameters and return types is often
found in a the manuals of your mud.  I cannot detail efuns here, because
efuns vary from driver to driver.  However, you can often access this
information using the commands "man" or "help" depending on your mudlib.
For instance, the command "man write" would give you information on the
write efun.
<p>

<h4>4.4 Defining your own functions</h4>

Although ordering your functions within the file does not matter, ordering
the code which defines a function is most important.  Once a function
has been called, function code is executed in the order it appears
in the function definition.  In <code>write_vals()</code> above, the
instruction
    
<code>
x = add(2, 2);
</code>

must come before the <code>write()</code> efun call if you want to see the
appropriate value of x used in <code>write()</code>.
<p>
With respect to values returned by function, this is done through the
<i>return</i> instruction followed by a value of the same data type as the
function.  In <code>add()</code> above, the instruction is <code>return
(x+y);</code>, where the value of (x+y) is the value returned to
<code>write_vals()</code> and assigned to x.  On a more general level,
<i>return</i> halts the execution of a function and returns code execution
to the caller of that function.  In addition, it returns to the calling
function the value of any expression that follows.
<p>
To stop the execution of a function of type void out of order, use
<code>return;</code> without any value following.  Once again, remember,
the data type of the value of any expression returned using <i>return</i>
<b>must</b> be the same as the data type of the function itself.

<h4>4.5 Chapter Summary</h4>

The files which define LPC objects are made of of functions.  Functions, in
turn, are made up of three parts:
<ul>
<li>The declaration
<li>The definition
<li>The call
</ul>
Function declarations generally appear at the top of the file before any
definitions, although the requirement is that the declaration must appear
before the function definition and before the definition of any function
which calls it.
<p>
Function definitions may appear in the file in any order so long as they
come after their declaration.  In addition, you may not define one function
inside another function.
<p>
Function calls appear inside the definition of other functions where you
want the code to begin execution of your function.  They may also appear
within the definition of the function itself, but this is not recommended
for new coders, as it can easily lead to infinite loops.
<p>
The function definition consists of the following in this order:
<ol>
<li>function return type
<li>function name
<li>opening bracket, followed by a parameter list and a closing bracket
<li>an opening { instructing the driver that execution begins here
<li>declarations of any variables to be used only in that function (local)
<li>instructions, expressions, and calls to other functions as needed
<li>a closing } stating that the function code ends here and, if no
<i>return</i> instruction has been given at this point (type void functions
only), execution returns to the calling function as if a <i>return</i>
instruction was given
</ol>

The trivial function would thus be:
<pre>
void 
do_nothing() 
{
}
</pre>
since this function does not accept any input, perform any instructions, or
return any output.
<p>
Any function which is not of type void <i>must</i> return a value of a data
type matching the function's data type.
<p>
Each driver has a set of functions already defined for you called efuns
These you need neither need to declare nor define since it has already
been done for you.  Furthermore, execution of these functions is faster
than the execution of your functions since efuns are in the driver.
In addition, each mudlib has special functions like efuns in that they
are already defined and declared for you, but different in that they
are defined in the mudlib and in LPC.  They are called simul_efuns, or
simulated efuns [in TTA afuns, functions of the auto-object, ed.].  You can
find out all about each of these as they appear in the manuals.
