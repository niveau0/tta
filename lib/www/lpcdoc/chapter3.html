Chapter 3: LPC Data Types
</font>
</h4>
</center>

<h4>3.1 What you should know by now</h4>

LPC objects are made up of zero or more variables manipulated by one or
more functions.  The order in which these functions appear in code is
irrelevant.  The driver uses the LPC code you write by loading copies of
it into memory whenever it is first referenced and additional copies
through cloning.  When each object is loaded into memory, all the variables
initially point to no value.  The initial function is used to give initial
values to variables in objects.  The function for creation is called
immediately after the object is loaded into memory.  However, if you are
reading this textbook with no prior programming experience, you may not
know what a function is or how it gets called.  And even if you have
programming experience, you may be wondering how the process of functions
calling each other gets started in newly created objects.  Before any of
these questions get answered, however, you need to know more about what it
is the functions are manipulating.  You therefore should thouroughly come
to know the concept behind LPC data types.  Certainly the most boring
subject in this manual, yet it is the most crucial, as 90% of all errors
(excepting misplaced () and {}) involve the improper usage of LPC data
types.  So bear through this important chapter, because it is my feeling
that understanding this chapter alone can help you find coding much, much
easier.

<h4>3.2 Communicating with the computer</h4>

You possibly already know that computers cannot understand the letters
and numbers used by humans.  Instead, the "language" spoken by computers
consists of an "alphabet" of 0's and 1's (power off/power on).  Certainly
you know computers do not understand natural human languages.  But in fact,
they do not understand the computer languages we write for them either.
Computer languages like BASIC, C, C++, Pascal, etc. are all intermediate
languages.  They allow you to structure your thoughts more coherently
for translation into the 0's and 1's of the computer's languages.
<p>
There are two methods in which translation is done: compilation and
interpretation.  These simply are differences between when the 
programming language is translated into computer language.  With
compiled languages, the programmer writes the code then uses a program
called a compiler to translate the program into the computer's
language.  This translation occurs before the program is run.  With
interpreted languages however, the process of translation occurs as
the program is being run.  Since the translation of the program is
occurring during the time of the program's running in interpreted
languages, interpreted languages make much slower programs than
compiled languages.
<p>
The bottom line is, no matter what language you are writing in, at
some point this has to be changed into 0's and 1's which can be
understood by the computer.  But the variables which you store in
memory are not simply 0's and 1's.  So you have to have a way in
your programming languages of telling the computer whether or not
the 0's and 1's should be treated as decimal numbers or characters or
strings or anything else.  You do this through the use of data types.
<p>
For example, say you have a variable which you call 'x' and you give
it the decimal whole number value 65.  In LPC you would do this through
the statement:
<p>
<code>
x = 65;
</code>
<p>
The problem for the computer is that it does not know what '65' means when
you tell it x = 65;.  What you think of 65, it might think of as:
<p>
00000000000000000000000001000001
<p>
But, also, to the computer, the letter 'A' is represented as:
<p>
00000000000000000000000001000001
<p>
So, whenever you instruct the computer to output "x", it must have some
way of knowing that you want to see '65' and not 'A'.
<p>
The computer can tell the difference between '65' and 'A' through the use
of data types.  A data types simply says what type of data is being stored
by the memory location pointed to by a given variable.  Thus, each LPC
variable has a variable type which guides conversions.  In the example
given above, you would have had the following line somewhere in the
code <i>before</i> the lines shown above:
<p>
int x;
<p>
This one line tells the driver that whatever value x points to, it will
be used as the data type "int", which is short for integer, or whole
number.  So you have a basic introduction into the reason why data types
exist.  They exist so the driver can make sense of the 0's and 1's that
the computer is storing in memory.

<h4>3.3 The data types of LPC</h4>

Normally LPMud drivers know the following data types:
<p>
<i>void, status, int, string, object, int *, string *, object *, mixed *</i>
<p>
Many drivers, but not all have the following important data types which
are important to discuss:
<p>
<i>float, mapping, float *, mapping *</i>
<p>
And there are a few drivers with the following rarely used data types
which are not important to discuss:
<p>
<i>function, enum, struct, char</i>

<h4>3.4 Simple data types</h4>

This introductory textbook will deal with the data types <i>void, status,
int, float, string, object</i> and <i>mixed</i>.  You can find out about the
more complex data types like <i>mappings</i> and <i>arrays</i> in the
intermediate textbook.  This chapter deals with the two simplest data types
(from the point of view of the LPC coder), <i>int</i> and <i>string</i>.
<p>
An <i>int</i> is any whole number.  Thus 1, 42, -17, 0, -10000023 are all
type <i>int</i>. 
A <i>string</i> is one or more alphanumeric characters.  Thus "a", "we are
borg", "42", "This is a string" are all <i>strings</i>.  Note that
<i>strings</i> are always enclosed in "" to allow the driver to distinguish
between the <i>int</i> 42 and the <i>string</i> "42" as well as to
distinguish between variable names (like x) and <i>strings</i> by the same
names (like "x"). 
<p>
When you use a variable in code, you must first let the driver know
what type of data to which that variable points.  This process is
called <b>declaration</b>.  You do this at the beginning of the function
or at the beginning of the object code (outside of functions before all
functions which use it).  This is done by placing the name of the data type
before the name of the variable like in the following example:
<pre>
void
add_two_and_two() 
{
    int x;
    int y;

    x = 2;
    y = x + x;
}
</pre>
Now, this is a complete function.  The name of the function is 
<code>add_two_and_two()</code>.  The function begins with the declaration
of an <i>int</i> variable named x followed by the declaration of an
<i>int</i> variable named y.  So now, at this point, the driver now has two
variables which point to <i>null</i> values, and it expects what ever
values end up there to be of type <i>int</i>.
<p>
A note about the data types <i>void</i> and <i>status</i>:<br>
<i>void</i> is a trivial data type which points to nothing.  It is not used
with respect to variables, but instead with respect to functions.  You
will come to understand this better later.  For now, you need only
understand that it points to no value.  
<p>
The data type <i>status</i> is a boolean data type.  That is, it can only have
1 or 0 as a value.  This is often referred to as being true or false.
[Type <i>status</i> does not exist for DGD, ed.]

<h4>3.5 Chapter summary</h4>

For variables, the driver needs to know how the 0's and 1's the computer
stores in memory get converted into the forms in which you intend them
to be used.  The simplest LPC data types are <i>void, status, int,</i> and
<i>string</i>.<p>
You do not use variables of type <i>void</i>, but the data type does come
into play with respect to functions.  In addition to being used for
translation from one form to the next, data types are used in determining
what rules the driver uses for such operations as +, -, etc.  For example,
in the expression 5+5, the driver knows to add the values of 5 and 5
together to make 10.<p>
With <i>strings</i> however, the rules for <i>int</i>
addition make no sense.  So instead, with "a"+"b", it appends "b" to the
string "a" so that the final string is "ab".  Errors can thus result if you
mistakenly try to add "5"+5.  Since <i>int</i> addition makes no sense with
<i>strings</i>, the driver will convert the second 5 to "5" and use string
addition.  The final result would be "55".  If you were looking for 10, you
would thereforehave ended up with erroneous code.<p>
Keep in mind, however, that in most instances, the driver will not do
something so useful as coming up with "55".  It comes up with "55" cause it
has a rule for adding a <i>string</i> to an <i>int</i>, namely to treat the
<i>int</i> as a <i>string</i>.  In most cases, if you use a data type for
which an operation or function is not defined (like if you tried to divide
"this is" by "nonsense"), the driver will barf and report an error to you.
