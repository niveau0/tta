Chapter 8: The data type "object"
</font>
</h4>
</center>

<h4>8.1 Review</h4>

You should now be able to do anything so long as you stick to calling
functions within your own object.  You should also know, that at the
bare minimum you can get the create() function in your object called to
start just by loading it into memory.<p>
You are also acquainted with the data types <i>void, int,</i> and
<i>string</i>. 
 
<h4>8.2 Objects as data types</h4>

In this chapter you will be acquainted with a more complex data type,
<i>object</i>.  An object variable points to a real object loaded into the
driver's memory.  You declare it in the same manner as other data types:
<pre>
object ob;
</pre>
It differs in that you cannot use +, -, +=, -=, *, or / (what would it
mean to divide a monster by another monster?).  And since efuns like
say() and write() only want strings or integer, you cannot write() or
say() them (again, what would it mean to say a monster?).
<p>
But you can use them with some other of the most important efuns on any
LPMud.
 
<h4>8.3 The efun: this_object()</h4>
This is an efun which returns an object in which the function being executed
exists.  In other words, in a file, this_object() refers to the object your
file is in whether the file gets cloned itself or inherited by another file.
It is often useful when you are writing a file which is getting inherited
by another file.  Say you are writing your own living.c which gets
inherited by player.c and monster.c, but never used alone.  You want to log 
the function set_level() if it is a player's level being set (but you do not
care if it is a monster).
You might do this:
<pre>
void 
set_level(int x) 
{
    if (this_object()->is_player())
        log_file("levels", "foo\n");
    level = x;
}
</pre>
 
Since is_player() is not defined in living.c or anything it inherits,
just using <code>if (is_player())</code> will result in an error since the
driver does not find that function in your file or anything it inherits.
<p>
this_object() allows you to access functions which may or may not be
present in any final products because your file is inherited by others
without resulting in an error.
 
<h4>8.4 Calling functions in other objects</h4>

This of course introduces us to the most important characteristic of
the object data type.  It allows us to access functions in other objects.
In previous examples you have been able to find out about a player's level,
reduce the money they have, and how much hp they have.
Calls to functions in other objects may be done in two ways:
<pre>
object->function(parameters);
call_other(object, "function", parameters);
</pre>
Example:
<pre>
this_player()->add_money("silver", -5);
call_other(this_player(), "add_money", "silver", -5);
</pre>
 
In some (very loose sense), the game is just a chain reaction of function
calls initiated by player commands.  When a player initiates a chain of
function calls, that player is the object which is returned by the function
this_player().  So, since this_player() can change depending on who
initiated the sequence of events, you want to be very careful as to where
you place calls to functions in this_player().
 
<h4>8.5 Adding objects to your rooms</h4>

And now, using the data type object, you can add monsters to your rooms
(even if this is an ugly example):
<pre>
object ob;

ob = clone_object("/base/living"); /* make a copy of the standard living */
ob->set_name("guard");
ob->set_short("Town guard");
ob->set_long("He guards Praxis from nothingness.\n");
ob->set_gender("male");
ob->set_race("human");
ob->move(room_object);
</pre>
Now, this will be wildly different on most muds.  The last act in most muds
is to call move() in the monster object to move it to the room.

<h4>8.6 Chapter summary</h4>
At this point, you now have enough knowledge to code some basic stuff.  Of
course, as I have been stressing all along, you really need to read the
documents on building for your mud, as they detail which functions exist in
which types of objects for you to call.
<p>
At this point you should get busy trying example stuff.  Right now code
yourself a small area. Make extensive use of the special functions coded in
your mud's room.c (search the docs for obscure ones no one else seems to
use). Add lots of neat actions.
<p>
Create weapons which have magic powers which gradually fade away.  All of
this you should be able to work out now.  Once this becomes routine for
you, it will be time to move on to intermediate stuff.  Note that few
people actually get to the intermediate stuff. If you have played at all,
you notice there are few areas on the mud which do what I just told you you
should be able to do.
