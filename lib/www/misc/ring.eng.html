During the third age, long before the ring-war began, the world was still
in uproar. Sauron the maiar, servant of the banned evil Morgoth, and his
dark minions always seeked for more might. The ringwraith, highest of Saurons
followers, fought wars against human and elves.<p>
In TTA you play a person living during the year 2400 t.a. The One Ring
(of which you see the inscription above) and all the other high rings
were already forged and Sauron lost his ruling ring. But nobody found it yet!
Or not? Find out by yourself...
