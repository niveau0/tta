			 About the creation of weapons

- set_wield_size(size, hands)
	To determine the correct wield size of a weapon, first think about
	how many hands are needed to wield/use the weapon.  E.g. a falchion
	may be wielded with one handed or with two hands by smaller people.
	But a bow needs a least 2 hands to work properly.
	After you have come to conclusion about the hands, you determine the
	sizevalue that needs to be available in the wielders hands.  E.g. a
	size of 1600 (and 2 hands maximum allowed) requires 1600 or less free
	space to wield the weapon one handed, or the value maybe split to wield
	it two handed (e.g. one hand 700 + the other 900 = 1600).
	How to compute the correct value? This depends on the size you like to
	see if the weapon needs two hands.  Maybe you want a dagger to be very
	huge so hobbits need to wield it with two hands.
	The wield size is then 
          (bodyvolume of wielder) / 100 * 3
        where body volume is the value at which the weapon is still to just use
	one hand.
	If hobbits would have a bodies volume around 30000, the wield size is
	900.  So if we want hobbits need both hands, the size needs to be
	greater then 900.  Take that value as the 'size' argument.
	The 'hands' argument takes value as following:
	- negative number: number of hands that must be used (for a two handed
	                   bow this is -2 then)
	- positive number: number of hands that could be used (for a sword 
			   maybe 2 - two hands allowed if one is not enough)
