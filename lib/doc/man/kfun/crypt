NAME
	crypt - encrypt a string

SYNOPSIS
	string crypt(string passwd, varargs string salt)


DESCRIPTION
	Encrypt a password, of which only the first 8 characters are
	significant.  If the optional second argument is given, its first two
	characters are used to perturb the encryption algorithm additionally;
	without one, the encryption is perturbed randomly.  The returned
	string is 13 characters long, the first two of which are equal to the
	used salt.
