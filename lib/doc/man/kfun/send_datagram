NAME
	send_datagram - send a message on the datagram channel
  OR      
        send_datagram - send a datagram


SYNOPSIS
	int send_datagram(string message)
  OR 
        int send_datagram(string data, string destination, int port)



DESCRIPTION
	This function has to different implementations: The first part in
        each section reffers to the original implementation of Dworking, the
        second part describes the behaviour of the function of the network
        package. Sorry for the confusion, but as there is only one available
        at a time, it shouldn't be big a problem. 

	Send a message on the datagram channel of a binary user object.  At
	least one message must have been received on the same channel before
	this function can be used.  The return value is the length of the
	message if it could be sent, or 0 otherwise.
	No more than one datagram can be sent per user object during each
	thread.
  OR 
	Send a UDP datagram to the specified host and udp port.  No hostname
        lookup is done so the destination must be an ip number.
        Only udp port objects can use this function.

	The length of the sent datagram is returned, or 0 if the 
        datagram could not be sent.

ERRORS
	An error will result if the current object has no datagram channel.
  OR 
        An error will result if the object is not an udp port object.
