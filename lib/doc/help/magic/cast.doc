*-------------------------------( Magic: Cast )------------------------------*

   Type:        command
   Usage:       cast '<power> <realm> <list> <spell>' <direction|target>

   Description: Cast is the command to invoke spells. Casting spells is 
                complex because you need to know the correct syllables
                to invoke a useful spell.
                The spell formula (without the target, see above) must be
		enclosed in quotes: '...'
                The first component is the power syllable, then the magic
                realm, then the spell list where the spell can be found,
                and last the spell name. Some spells need an additional
                component, e.g. a spell to enhance your language skill must
                know which language.
                Depending on the type of spell you need to specify a target
		or a direction. A direction is given as a distance to your 
		current position, e.g. 1n2e means 1 feet north and 2 feet 
		east of yourself.
                
   Example:     cast 'en cha cor hle' me
    	    	  this is the correct formula to cast a spell on 
    	    	  yourself (if you know that spell of course)
