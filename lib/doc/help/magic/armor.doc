*-------------------------------( Magic: Armor )-----------------------------*

   Wearing heavy armor while casting spells  is not very advisable. Certain 
   type of magic energies are often blocked by metal or thick leather.    
   Careful!   You may find your  brain burning like a  torch if you miss to
   remove your helmet before using the mental-realm powers.
