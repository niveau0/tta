   Description:     You need this skill to participate in magical
                    contention common among mages. Both contestant
                    stand opposite each other. A large ball of
                    magical energie appears between them, that has
                    the tendency to skip towards one of the contestant.
                    You can make the ball skip toward to your opponent
                    by pumping mana into the sphere. Your opponent will
                    do the same. The more mana you invest the greater
                    the strain on your mind gets. The one who is
                    hit by the ball is attacked by all the magical
                    energy stored in sphere up to this point.
