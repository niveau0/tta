*------------------------( Communication: Language )-------------------------*

   What kind  of language you speak will  greatly influence your ability to
   communicate with other people you might meet on your travels. Unless you
   are adept in  other languages, you will not  be able to  understand what
   might be going on.
   The following languages are known to be used:

   Westron       --     mostly used language by the humans 
   Roheric       --     the language of Rohan
   Adunaic       --     old numenorean language (later westron)
   Quenya        --     old elvish tongue (used by the highelves)
   Sindarin      --     mostly used language by the elves
   Khuzdul       --     language of the dwarves
   Black speech  --     the tongue of Mordor and evil

   Your race will, naturally, influence the languages you will speak in the
   beginning, but if you are succeed to find a teacher you might be able to
   learn most other languages in someday.
