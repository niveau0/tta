*------------------------------( Builder: cd )-------------------------------*
 
   Type:        command
   Usage:       cd <directory | path>
		cd ..
		cd -here
		cd -<objectname>
		
   Description: Just like the UNIX command, 'cd' stands for change directory.
		It is used by the Gods to change from their current working 
		directory to another specified directory.  This can be 
		accomplished in a variety of ways. 

		cd <directory | path> : means that you give a specified 
					path as a argument.

		cd .. : means that you want to move up one directory level.
			You can also use / as a seperator (cd ../..)

		cd -here : means that you want to change your current working 
			   directory to the directory of the room you are 
			   currently standing in.

		cd -<objectname> : means that you want to change your current 
				   working directory to the directory of an 
				   object living or non-living (player/NPC/
				   object) that is in your room or inventory.
 
   Example:  	> cd /home/erikose/room
	    	/home/erikose/room
		
		> cd ..
		/home/erikose   

		> cd -here
		Switching to /d/Standard/Bree/room.

		> cd -cadderly
		Switching to /config/race/ainu.
