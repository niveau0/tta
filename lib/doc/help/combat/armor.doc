*------------------------------( Combat: Armor )-----------------------------*

   The armor is one of the most important thing to survive a hard fight (if
   you prefer to proof  yourself in combat).  But it's not easy to find the
   best fitting protection.  There are several  points a  fighter must take 
   care of.
   Moving around like a tank in heavy armor is very difficult.  Be sure you
   are skilled enough.  A metal plate is obviously the best protection, but
   it is very time wasting to put it on or  remove it (imagine a surprising
   attack at night). 
   Armor (especially metal)  conflicts with magic.  If you are a spell user
   keep in mind that armor increases the failure of certain magic effects.
