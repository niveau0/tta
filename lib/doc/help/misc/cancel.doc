*-------------------------------( Misc: Cancel )-----------------------------*

   Type:        command
   Usage:       cancel [<spell> on <target>]
                
   Description: 'cancel' without arguments cancels your running commands. 
    	    	So if you are removing your cloth you can stop removing
    	    	more, or if you have typed a lot directions you can cancel
    	    	the command queue.
    	    	Another use of the cancel command is to break spells you 
    	    	have cast on someone. 
                
   Example:     cancel
		cancel sutra on fingol
    	    	 (this stops the spell 'sutra' if it still affects 
    	    	  Fingol and if the spell was invoked by yourself)
