   Usage:       accept all from <name>

       		accept nothing
                
   Description: If someone is offering you some items, you need to accept 
		those to get them. 'accept all' and 'accept nothing' allows 
                you to set your default behaviour. But be careful, if you
		take all without taking a look, it might happen that an
		assassin kills you with a nasty poison.
