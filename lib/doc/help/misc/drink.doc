*------------------------------( Misc: Drink )-------------------------------*

   Type:        command
   Usage:       drink from <item>

   Description: Depending on your constitution your body will show you more
                or less often, that you are thirsty. 
                'You get an inconsiderable feeling of thirst.'
                How thirsty or hungry you are, can be also seen in your 
                personal informations ('stats').
                Water or other drinks are mostly available in pubs (they sell
                small flasks) but you can also satisfy your thirst at wells,
                fountains or rivers ('drink from river|well|fountain').
		Drink something when you get thirsty to avoid the death 
                caused by thirst.

   Example:     drink from flask
