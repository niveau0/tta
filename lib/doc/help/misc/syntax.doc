*-------------------------------( Misc: Syntax )-----------------------------*

   This is an explanation of the help syntax and how to read it.
   
   The help pages and direct command help (if you input something useless)
   uses a special syntax to give as much help as possible.

   Example: typing only 'cast' results in 

            > cast '<power> <realm> <list> <spell>' <target|direction>
   
   Special letters:
    < >    - all words between < > need to be replaced by something. 
             E.g. <name> requires a name as replacement.
    |      - an alternative possibility.  In the example you may replace 
      	     the last < > with a target OR a direction.
    [ ]    - an optional argument. E.g. [name] shows you that you may give
             the word 'name' as argument or nothing, but [<name>] means
             you may give _a_name_ as argument or nothing.
