*-------------------------------( Rules: Ooc )-------------------------------*
 
   OOC  is an abbreviation for  out-of-character (like IC for in-character).   
   Acting out of  character means, you do  something that does  not fit into
   your  characters life, e.g.  switching of  your TV  at home.  OOC actions
   destroy the atmosphere of the fantasy  game if abused. Therefore you need
   to mark that  you want to  say something out-of-character so others won't  
   get confused  and, what  is more  important, keep  your ooc actions  to a 
   minimum. It is surely needed to to say "sorry, need to leave the keyboard
   for dinner", but it is totally unimportant  to remind that the monster in
   the next room has 20 hitpoints or that your sword  skill is at '42'. This
   knowledge is totally unknown to your character.
   Misusage of OOC information will not be tolerated by the administration to
   keep the fantasy character of the game.
