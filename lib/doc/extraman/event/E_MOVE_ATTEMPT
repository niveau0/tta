Event:     E_MOVE_ATTEMPT

Called:    Whenever an object is about to change its environment _and_ it is
           allowed to forbid the following movement, a move-attempt event is
           called for this object, its old environment and destination.

Usage:     Add an event (see add_event), create an event handling function, 
           that will be called if the event occurs:
	   int function(object o, object from, object to) { ... }
           
           if the function returns an integer != 0, moving is forbidden.

Arguments: object o    - the object that _wants_ to move
           object from - the former environment
           object to   - the new environment
