Event:     E_HEAP_MERGE

Called:    Whenever a heap object moves and merges with another object, or
           a split clone is created, this event is initiated within the 
           merging heap. If the heap doesn't move completly, argument 'heap'
           is the heap where it splits from. If the heap is moving completly,
           'heap' is the object that existed before at the destination but 
           now merges and then disappears. If there was no such heap at the 
           destination, then 'heap' is 0. 
	   Summarized, 'heap' is always the other heap object that might be 
           involved in the merge-process.

Usage:     Add an event (see add_event), create an event handling function, 
           that will be called if the event occurs:
	   void function(object heap, int growSize) { ... }

Arguments: object heap  - the heap that shrinks or merges 
                          (and therefore gets removed after move)
           int growSize - how many units transfer
