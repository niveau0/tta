  About coding standards
--------------------------

  The code in 'The Third age' (TTA) should look unitary.
  This is to encourage the overview and it helps to make new creations or 
  removal of bugs.

  Some guidelines that need to be followed are listed below.

  * one main rule is: Don't write code-lines that exceed the length of 79
    characters (means: every 79 characters you must insert a newline)

  * the main indentation value is '4'. Example:
    
    if (expression)
    {
        expression; /* 4 spaces indentation */
        expression; /* 4 spaces indentation */
    }
    
  * always start opening a new 'block' (with '{') after a newline. Example:
    Don't use:
    
    if (expression) {
        expression;
        expression;
    }

    Use:

    if (expression) 
    {
        expression;
        expression;
    }

  * always have a space before opening brackets, never have a space between
    a function name and it's arguments. Example:
    
    if (a == b)
        a = b + (c - d);
    but:
        function(a, b, c);

  * use no blocks if not needed, means:
    if (expression)
	expression; /* needs no block */

    but:

    if (expression) 
    {
        expression; /* two expressions need a block mark */
        expression;
    }

  * optimisation is really wanted/needed. Get in touch with the 'auto-object'
    (maybe ask someone about it?) and figure out whats best to replace with
    a local variable. Example:
 
    Using an indexed array inside a loop is slower (execution cost) than using
    a local variable to store the value and use the stored in the loop:

    for (i=0; i<1000; i++)
        if (a[i] == b || a[i] == c || a[i] == d)
            expression;

    Better:

    int e; /* assuming that all a[i] are integer values */
    
    for (i=0; i<1000; i++)
    {
	e = a[i];
        if (e == b || e == c || e == d)
            expression;
    }

  * don't use permanently running callouts (if they are short-timed) and don't 
    do much inside those call_out functions. Keep them running fast.

  * don't add 1000 comments if you fixed a bug like:
    /* fixed foo-bug on date bar */
    Better send a mail to the original coder.
