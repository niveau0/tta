Southward lies a wide entrance and you can see an interior that\nreminds you of a stable. Westward begins an arched tunnel leading further into\nthat direction. You notice a window in the northeastern and two in the\nnorthwestern corner of the yard.\nA little stair lies close to the wall directly north of the tunnel, ending at\nthe stoop of a door.\n"
