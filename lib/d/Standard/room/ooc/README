 This is the out-of-character area, which is only reachable for mortals during
 the login procedure. 
 It is not allowed to transfer mortals from the 'in-character' rooms into these
 'out-of-character' rooms.

 The ooc area contains some boards to discuss the game, leave some ideas or to
 talk with the creators about some things which could be done better.

 Also it is the only area where the 'who' command is available to mortals.
