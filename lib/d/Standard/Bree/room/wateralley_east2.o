Little houses of wood, stone and sometimes brick stand\nside by side all along the street's border. Several of them have signs or\nshields that tout wares of all kinds.\nAt about the middle of its east-western length the road has a crossing with a\nway branching off to the north. It curves northward in the east.\n"
