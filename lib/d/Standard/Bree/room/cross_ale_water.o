Obviously much more people travel on the other road than on this\none.\nEast and west this part of the road is flanked by two houses with the inviting\nmanners of shops, while to the north you see the road continue until it ends\nclose to the citywall which dominates the northern view at this place as well\nas the southern one. As you peep through between the buildings around, you\nspot grassy areas to the northeast and northwest.\n"
