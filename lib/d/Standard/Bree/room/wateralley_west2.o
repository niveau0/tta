room_long "The road follows its main east-west direction and connects a large place to\nthe east with scattered dwellings to the west. The road itself is plastered\nwith cobblestones to prevent it from turning into a muddy slide in cases of\nrainy weather. Your direct line of sight westward is blocked by a building,\nbut north and south of it you spot grassy areas and, limiting them, the\ncitywall. At the southeastern end, near the large place, you see a smaller\nbuilding with a chimney that produces light grey smoke. Several houses are\nsituated direct north of the road.\n"
