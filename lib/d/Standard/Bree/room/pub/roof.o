At the eastern wall you notice a metal pipe\nemerging from the planks of the floor and going up through the boards of the\nceiling. These boards have a strong slope due to the fact that they are fixed\ndirectly under the roof. Within the southern wall sits a single window as a\nconcession to the fact that light is not for free in a stonebuilding.\n"
