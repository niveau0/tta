South of of the gate the citywall has a bend as\nit turns first west and then southwest as far as you can see. Within this bend\nsits a house with grey stonewalls. North of it, across the road, is another\nhouse that is built much less robust. The road itself continues to the west\nuntil it vanishes in a curve. About halfway between the citygate and the curve\nyou notice another, smaller road leading northward from a little crossing.\nNear the crossing you realize different houses with the appearance of shops\nthat are spread among buildings with a more private appearance.\n"
