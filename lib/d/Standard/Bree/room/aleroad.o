Directly at the end you see a building, most\nprobable the reason for the existance of the road.\nThis part of the town is not populated very dense, considered by the large\nlots with wild plants being their only occupants. Beside the lots east and\nwest of the road there are another two houses more to the south which owners\npreferred the proximity to the bigger road that goes there in eastwestern\ndirection.\n"
