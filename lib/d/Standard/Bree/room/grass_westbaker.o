room_long "This large place is overgrown with short grass and lies in the western part of\nthe town, judged by the citywall that stretches along the western border of\nthe area. At the eastern edge of the grassy plain you notice two houses and a\nsmall alley between them that goes east. A bigger road is found at the\nnorthern part, where it leads in an east-western direction until it turns\nnorth in front of a building. To the west you cannot recognize too much as the\naforementioned citywall thwarts every attempt to look further. Another also\nvacant area of grass lies to the southeast and the inevitable citywall towers\nbehind it.\n"
