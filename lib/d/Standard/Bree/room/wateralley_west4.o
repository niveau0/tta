room_long "This is the most western part of the town, where the citywall raises closely\nand entering as well as leaving the city is possible by a big opening within\nit. The road beneath you passes this gate to the west and to the east it\nenters the the cluttered center of the city. Looking around you see the\ncitywall, with a small zone of green before it, disappearing into a\nsoutheastern direction on one hand and leaving north with a bend to the east\nthen on the other hand. Not far from that bend sits a little house that has\nappearantly been made from the same stones as the citywall. You cannot resist\nthe thought that it belongs to the construction of the wall.\nAt a second glance eastwards you notice a crossing where a small road splits\noff northwards.\n"
