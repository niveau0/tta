A single building has been placed on the narrow space\nbetween wall and road, giving shelter and protection to its inhabitants.\nLooking again toward the building in the east you recognize a large area of\nuneven ground behind it.\nThe southern direction reveals none too interesting facts. Some buildings, a\nroad with a bend in it and spottable between and behind them grass and in the\ndistance the citywall that made its way from here around the whole town.\n"
