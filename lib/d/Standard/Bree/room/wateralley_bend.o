The way to the west lies at the\nnorthern end, while the southern end of the bend lies at a street to the east.\nThis part of the town is densely populated, judged by the many houses you see\neast and west of the street and by the roofs and chimneys you see beyond the\nbuildings in front of you. Especially southeast from here the road gets wider\nand has some shops along it sides.\nBehind the houses in the north and the south you become aware of high walls\nthat prohibit uncontrolled visits of the town.\n"
