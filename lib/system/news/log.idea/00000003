What about not showing the whole room description, if you frequently pass an
exit?
Example: Somebody runs through a lot of rooms. Instead of printing always the
whole roomdescription, the program could look, if the last passing of an exit
happened less than a second ago. If it is that way, the program just prints
the short description and items/players/npcs. I've seen this method in another
MUD and found it quite useful.
