Right now, the question wether an object is burning or not is answered by
calling query_burning() in this object. I think it will be difficult to
light objects, that haven't inherited /base/light, like a cloak, or a book.
But these objects definately SHOULD burn. What about including /base/light
in /base/objects? Or can this part of code be inherited during runtime,
when it is needed?
