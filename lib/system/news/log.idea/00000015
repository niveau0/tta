I think you will take a bow into your secondary hand(e.g. left hand
for right handers) when you wield a bow. You will only use the other
hand when you want to shoot an arrow. This allows you to wield a bow
and a single handed weapon at the same time, but you will only be able
to shoot the bow when you have one hand free.
