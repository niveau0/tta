The command 'stats' should also give information about the player's range
of sight, because it is hard to decide wether you should run (being in a
thick foggy cloud, knowing the abyss has to be close) or walk pretty slowly
and carefully. ;) I mean, you don't know if there is nothing, because there
is INDEED nothing or because it's only to dark to see anything beyond your
nose without this info.
