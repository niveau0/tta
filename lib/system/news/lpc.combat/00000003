Weapon and armor have been changed a lot. Now the armor doesn't contain
the critical threshold anymore. Only the weapon stores its attack values
against each armor type. There are many new definitions for the attack-
modifiers and OB-modifiers (see file <combat.h> and the manuals for
weapon/ and armor/, also have a look at the updated files in /lib/weapon
and /lib/armor to understand the new configuration.)

This was done to make combat more flexible and weapons easier to balance.
