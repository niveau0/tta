Hello!

How many classes do you think belong to spirits/ghosts?
In fact, I think ghosts are a kind of undead!
But I feel we might need a class for entities from other planes
called demons. Artificial beings like sentinels, gargoyles and golems
could be placed in special though.

Just my two pennies. :)
