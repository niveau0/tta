A new command 'return' teleports back to the edit-room if you left it
un'done'.
Its not possible to remove exits instead of adding them after specifing
the offsets.
An exitpath can now be 'relative', e.g. if you are editing a room within
directory /home/manwe and want to connect it to another room
directory, you can use just the relative pathname.

Example: to connect /home/manwe/home with /home/ulmo/test the exitpath
         is:  ../ulmo/test
