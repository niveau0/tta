The /base/book.c file got changed. Now a book consists of just two files,
the contents (a .o datafile) and the book itself (to clone).
If you want to write to a book, create a book file (the .c file), then
use the 'write on title|page <no> of book' command.
For a first example look at /lib/book/poison.c
