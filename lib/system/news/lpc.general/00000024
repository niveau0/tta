The functionality of reload_data and init_reload has been changed.
If you want to save data of an object carried by a player over to his/her 
next login, you have to announce two functions via 'add_reload'.
One (the reload function) is used to query all data that should be saved,
the second (the init function) is called (with your reloading data as 
argument) if the reloading should occur.
See /lib/food/meat.c as an example
 (which is saving its current weight, volume etc.)
