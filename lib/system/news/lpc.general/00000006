/include/mudtime.h now contains a definition for day and night light-values.
DAYLIGHT and NIGHTLIGHT.

all in all lightvalue has now changed to its final semantic:
each lightunit (i.d. integer 1 is one lightunit) allows one inch view
distance.
That means, light 3000 equals view distance 3000 inch.
But you may notice that someone carring a lightsource can be seen up to the
maximum sight-distance of the viewer.
