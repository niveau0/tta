3 new standard files to support the cooking skill:
/include/ingredients.h with definitions for all ingredients (will be extended)
/include/recipe.h, holding all recipes (potions, etc.)
/base/misc/cook.c, the cook cmd support to inherit for all cooking 
                   containers.

/base/object.c got two new functions, set_ and query_ingredient, read the
manuals.
