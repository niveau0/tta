The new internal exit format is finished now. Walking works again and the
room creator has been adapted to the new format. Old rooms will update
their exits themself (the upgrade code will be removed after some days, so
please make sure your rooms have been loaded once).

Walking between rooms with different floor height follows soon. For now
new is the line-of-sight behaviour of exits. You will only see items in 
the neighbour room which are within your 'line of sight' (not blocked by the
rooms walls).
