It's now possible to set special protection slot for an armor.
E.g. if you want to create a magic ring not only protecting the finger
(nonsense of course ;) you just set extra protection slots.
Default (if you never call set_protection()) are the locations where
the armor is worn.
See set_protection and query_protection.
