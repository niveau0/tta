Both functions are useless now, they won't be called any longer by move().
Use the E_MOVE event instead.
E.g.:
in create() do: add_event(E_MOVE, "function-name", this_object());

where 'function-name' is the function that will be called if the object
is moved. Also read the manual page about E_MOVE.

PS: this will require some doors to be repaired. Most have been changed
    already.
