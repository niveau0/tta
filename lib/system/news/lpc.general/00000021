I renamed the properties to check for a certain item time (like HEAP_IS, 
PLANT_IS etc.) and added some more. Also there are no more the also used
check_functions (like check_heap() etc.).

The fixed usage is now:
  object->query_prop(IS_<itemtype>)
e.g.
  object->query_prop(IS_HEAP)  or
  object->query_prop(IS_ARMOR)

Manwe
